    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Accra has this energy that just gets to you, and that's why it's my favorite city. The whole place just feels
        aliveâ€”a brilliant mess of sights and sounds. And the people are a huge part of it; they're so warm and
        welcoming, you feel right at home. You can see so much history and so much future all at once. Plus, the music
        is everywhere,
        and it just grabs you. Honestly, it's a city with a huge heart, and that's what makes it so special and unique.
